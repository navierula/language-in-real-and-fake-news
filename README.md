# What makes a news story real or fake?

I am working to detect linguistic differences in real vs. fake news articles!

The dataset that I will be using to perform my task can be found [here](https://github.com/BenjaminDHorne/fakenewsdata1).
The paper that talks about the dataset can be found [here] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09398.pdf).
