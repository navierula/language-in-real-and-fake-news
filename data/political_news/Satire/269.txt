NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, called Donald J. Trump a “genius” on Monday for his controversial plan to burn down the White House to collect insurance money.

Appearing on Fox News, Christie said that Trump’s scheme to collect fire-insurance payments on the White House would “make a serious dent” in the national debt.

“It’s not just the White House,” Christie told Fox’s Sean Hannity. “That building is chock-full of priceless antiques, paintings, and rugs, all of which, when burned, would fetch a pretty penny.”

The New Jersey governor said that Trump’s “totally genius business acumen” would set him apart from all previous Presidents. “We’ve had forty-plus occupants of the White House, and not one of them ever considered the business advantages of burning it down,” Christie said.

Christie called criticism of the plan to burn down the White House “typical media bias,” and said that Trump was moving forward with plans to see “how much he could get” for burning down the Lincoln Memorial.
