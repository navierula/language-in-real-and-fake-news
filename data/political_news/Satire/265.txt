LAS VEGAS (The Borowitz Report)—In what is being denounced by Republicans as an “outrageous dirty trick,” Hillary Clinton is seeking to seal a victory in the third Presidential debate by inviting Donald Trump to attend.

The attention-grabbing invitation, which was widely seen as retaliation for the Trump campaign’s decision to invite President Obama’s estranged half brother, Malik, to the televised forum, sparked howls of protest from Republicans, who charged that Clinton was trying to gain an unfair advantage in the contest.

But Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, defended the controversial invitation. “If they’re going to have Malik at the debate, then we’re going to have Donald Trump,” he said. “Two can play this game.”

Appearing on CNN, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, blasted the Clinton campaign’s invitation of Trump as “a blatant ploy to rig the debate.”

“I know Hillary Clinton wants to try every trick in the book to win this debate, but inviting Donald Trump is really beyond the pale,” she said. “She should be ashamed of herself.”
