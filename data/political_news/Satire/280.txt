Background
In high school, Alexander participated in Model United Nations and successfully negotiated a peace accord between the Jordan delegate who was accused of stealing the lunch money of the Chilean delegate. Alexander attended the least-elitist Oxford college, Balliol, known for its laid-back attitude and having only three British Prime Ministers as alumni. His marriage to a Danish woman was arranged by Canada and Denmark to prevent further bloodshed in the conflict over Hans Island. While working as a diplomat for many years, he became tired of negotiation, compromise, and understanding, so he entered Canadian politics. In the Harper Cabinet, he required all new immigrants to remove their niqabs and wear their favourite NHL hockey jersey during citizenship oath ceremonies. He is best known for his undercover investigation of CBC host Rosemary Barton which found her solely responsible for causing the Syrian refugee crisis and then never reporting on it.
