WASHINGTON—In a letter addressed to Congress that was quickly followed by a second message retracting the first, FBI director James Comey is said to have briefly reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails for several more minutes Friday. “The FBI has learned of materials pertinent to this case and will be reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server to send classified information,” Comey wrote to the nation’s senators and representatives at 9:18 a.m. before writing another letter at 9:21 a.m. that read “Actually, we gave it a quick check, and everything looks fine here. Sorry about that!” At press time, Comey had reportedly reopened the investigation after a new document had come to light.
