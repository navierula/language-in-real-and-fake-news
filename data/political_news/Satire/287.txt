OTTAWA — In a symbolic gesture aimed at demonstrating the “shared values” she hopes will serve as the foundation of strong diplomatic relations between her party and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Conservative leadership hopeful Kellie Leitch has borrowed the former reality TV star’s beloved dog whistle.

“Mr. Trump’s victory is a call to arms for Old Stock Canadians who’ve been silenced for too long by the oppressive decency and tolerance of PC culture,” the Simcoe-Grey MP said in a statement. “This country is supposed to be the Great White North, and by following our American neighbors’ example, I am confident we can take our country back from the global elites who’ve perverted our traditional family values with their barbaric cultural practices. And you know who I’m talking about.”

“But just in case you don’t, I mean kikes, dykes, fags, and head rags. …Sorry, I’ve never used one of these before.”

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team said that, while the President-elect appreciates Leitch’s ham-fisted attempts to blow the same dog whistle that propelled him to his stunning victory, the fact remains that “Mr. Trump has no interest whatsoever in a woman over 40 blowing anything.”
