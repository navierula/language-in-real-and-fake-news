NEW YORK—Telling several members of the investment bank’s board of directors how they had to check her out whenever they get a chance, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was overheard Monday describing to friends how incredible it is to see Hillary Clinton live. “You can forget any recordings you’ve heard of Hillary, because they don’t even compare to the experience of seeing her in person,” said Blankfein, who excitedly recounted the first time he saw the Democratic presidential nominee in a small, intimate venue back in 2013, noting how he was instantly captivated by what he was hearing and found himself nodding along throughout the 90-minute solo performance. “Honestly, I wasn’t a big fan of hers going in, but she definitely changed my mind when I heard her up there onstage. All her material was amazing. She does not disappoint.” Blankfein then reportedly assured his friends that seeing Clinton in person was worth every cent of what it costs and that they wouldn’t regret it at all.
